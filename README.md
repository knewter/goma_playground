GomaPlayground
==============

This is just a stupid repo where I'm playing with goma, which is (I shit you
not) sort of like "Webmachine for Gopher".  I'm going to use it to drive a
tetris interface so you can push commands into a running `extris` game and see
available commands from the gopher index.  Because there's something wrong with
me? :)
